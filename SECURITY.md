# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Line-by-Line journaling application to protect user data and prevent common security vulnerabilities.

## Authentication & Authorization

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Supabase Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
   - Automatic session management and refresh
   - Password hashing handled by Supabase Auth

2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - All database tables have RLS enabled
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Policies enforce user ownership on all CRUD operations

3. **API Authentication**
   - All API endpoints require valid JWT tokens
   - User ownership verification on all requests
   - Bearer token validation in Authorization headers

4. **Protected Routes**
   - Client-side route protection with authentication checks
   - Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users
   - Loading states to prevent unauthorized access

## Data Protection

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   - Content length limits (10,000 characters max)
   - Date format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - UUID format validation for entry IDs
   - Type checking for all input parameters

2. **Output Sanitization**
   - Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
   - No sensitive data in error responses
   - Removed debug logging that exposed user data

3. **Database Security**
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletion
   - Unique constraints to prevent data duplication

## API Security

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - 100 requests per minute for general API endpoints
   - 5 authentication attempts per 15 minutes
   - Automatic cleanup of old rate limit data

2. **Request Validation**
   - Method validation (GET, POST only)
   - Required field validation
   - User ownership verification

3. **Error Handling**
   - Generic error messages (no internal details)
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - No stack traces exposed to clients

## Infrastructure Security

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Security Headers**
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) in production
   - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
   - Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin
   - Permissions-Policy: restricted

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Sensitive keys stored in environment variables
   - .env files properly gitignored
   - No hardcoded secrets in source code

3. **CORS Protection**
   - Supabase handles CORS configuration
   - No custom CORS headers that could weaken security

## Data Privacy

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **User Data Isolation**
   - Each user can only access their own entries
   - No cross-user data access possible
   - Database queries filtered by user_id

2. **Minimal Data Collection**
   - Only essential user data stored
   - No tracking or analytics data
   - No third-party data sharing

3. **Data Retention**
   - User data deleted when account is deleted (CASCADE)
   - No data retention beyond user control

## Security Best Practices

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Code Security**
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - ESLint for code quality
   - No eval() or dangerous functions
   - Input sanitization throughout

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - No known vulnerable packages
   - Minimal dependency footprint

3. **Development Security**
   - No debug logging in production
   - Secure development practices
   - Code review process

## Security Monitoring

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Error Logging**
   - Server-side error logging
   - No sensitive data in logs
   - Structured error handling

2. **Access Monitoring**
   - Supabase provides access logs
   - Rate limiting provides abuse detection
   - Authentication events tracked

## Known Limitations

1. **Client-Side Security**
   - JWT tokens stored in browser memory
   - Client-side validation can be bypassed
   - Relies on server-side validation

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - In-memory rate limiting (resets on server restart)
   - IP-based identification (can be spoofed with proxies)

3. **Data Encryption**
   - Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
   - Data encrypted at rest (Supabase)
   - No client-side encryption

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Implement IP allowlisting for admin access
   - Add request logging and monitoring
   - Consider implementing 2FA
   - Regular security audits

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Regular security assessments

3. **Compliance**
   - GDPR compliance for EU users
   - Data retention policies
   - Privacy policy and terms of service

## Incident Response

1. **Security Breach Response**
   - Immediately revoke compromised tokens
   - Investigate and contain the breach
   - Notify affected users if necessary
   - Document lessons learned

2. **Vulnerability Disclosure**
   - Responsible disclosure policy
   - Security contact information
   - Bug bounty program (future consideration)
